Overview
---


This project focuses on **image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The goal is to build a deep learning model capable of accurately categorizing images into multiple classes. The project follows a structured pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment, ensuring high performance and scalability.

Key Components:
---

* Convolutional Layers (Conv2D) â€“ Extract features from images.

* MaxPooling Layers â€“ Reduce spatial dimensions and computational cost.

* Flatten Layer â€“ Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.

* Dense Layers â€“ Fully connected layers for classification.

* Softmax Activation â€“ Outputs probability distribution over classes.
